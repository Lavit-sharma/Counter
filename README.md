# Counter
This Counter Web App is a simple application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical counter. The application features three buttons: a "+" button to increase the count, a "â€“" button to decrease it, and a "Reset" button to set the count back to zero. The project showcases basic web development skills and includes a clean and modern design achieved through CSS. To get started, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and open the index.html file in your web browser. The HTML structure provides the layout, while the JavaScript adds interactivity by handling the button clicks and updating the displayed count. This project is a great way to practice fundamental web development concepts and can be further enhanced with additional features.
